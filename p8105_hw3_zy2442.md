## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and … columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\!\!

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data.

``` r
accel_df= (
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv")%>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      activity_1:activity_1440,
      names_to = "minute_of_a_day",
      names_prefix = "activity",
      values_to = "activity_counts") %>%
  mutate(minute_of_a_day = (as.numeric(as.factor(minute_of_a_day)))) %>% 
    mutate(
      weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
        day != c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "weekday",
        day == c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend",
        TRUE                           ~ ""))
      
    )
```

After tidy the dataset, there are 50400 observations and 6 variables,
which are week, day\_id, day, minute\_of\_a\_day, activity\_counts,
weekday\_vs\_weekend.

``` r
accel_df= (
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv")%>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      activity_1:activity_1440,
      names_to = "minute_of_a_day",
      names_prefix = "activity",
      values_to = "activity_counts") %>% 
  mutate(minute_of_a_day = (as.numeric(as.factor(minute_of_a_day))))%>% 
    mutate(
      weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
        day != c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "weekday",
        day == c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend",
        TRUE                           ~ "")) %>% 
    group_by(week, day) %>% 
    summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_counts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(activity_rank = min_rank(total_activity)) %>% 
        knitr::kable()
      )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

There is no obvious trend over total activity for each day during these
three weeks. However, to some degree, the total activity counts for
Tuesday and Wednesday are relatively stable, which are always within
350000\~470000 counts across these three weeks. Besides, the rank of the
total activity also shows that the rank of Tuesday is relative stable
compared to other days, which always ranks 2,3 or 4 within a week.

``` r
accel_plot = 
  accel_df= (
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv")%>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      activity_1:activity_1440,
      names_to = "minute_of_a_day",
      names_prefix = "activity",
      values_to = "activity_counts")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(minute_of_a_day = (as.numeric(as.factor(minute_of_a_day))))

accel_plot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = minute_of_a_day, y = activity_counts, color = day)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_zy2442_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

The scatter plot indicates the pattern that the male has relatively
higher activity counts during the 250\~280 minutes for mostly Monday,
Friday and Saturday; 550\~1125 minutes for mostly Thursday, Friday and
Sunday over weeks. For Tuesday and Wednesday, the activity counts are
relatively stable over the whole day compared to other days.

## Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
library(ggpubr)
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns. The observations are
some weather data – Precipitation, Snowfall,Snow depth, Maximum
temperature, Minimum temperature of different weather stations. There
are 7 variables, which contains character variables – id,tmax,tmin; date
variable – date;integer varibales – prcp, snow, snwd. The missing data
in each variable could be an issue since we might not know the weather
changes as time went by.

``` r
ny_noaa_df=
  ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, c("year","month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    day = as.integer(day)) %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
         year = as.character(year),
         month = as.character(month))

ny_noaa_df %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 x 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    NA  381221
    ##  3    25   31022
    ##  4    13   23095
    ##  5    51   18274
    ##  6    76   10173
    ##  7     8    9962
    ##  8     5    9748
    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # … with 272 more rows

For Snowfall, 0 is the most commonly observed value since it shows up
most often among all observed values. Similarly, 25 is the second most
commonly observed values; 13 is the third most commonly observed values.

``` r
plot_df=
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(month == c("1","7")) %>%
  group_by(id, year, month, tmax) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax)
  )%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, color = id)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_grid(. ~ month)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'id', 'year', 'month' (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot1 = 
ny_noaa_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax))+
  geom_bin2d()

plot2 = 
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(snow > 0,
         snow <100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow, fill = year))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

ggarrange(plot1, plot2, 
          labels = c("A", "B"),
          ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 1136276 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin2d).
